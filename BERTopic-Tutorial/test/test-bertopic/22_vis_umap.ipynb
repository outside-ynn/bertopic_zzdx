The objective is not only to recover the experimental value of the ground state mean energy of the atom, but rather to better approximate the unknown parameters of these trial\n",

          "Superconductors possessing diverse symmetry-enforced topological states have been subject of intense interest as they are arguably one of the most feasible candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity, source of Majorana fermions that hold great promise for topological quantum computing. Here we study the low-lying quasiparticle excitations in the superconducting intermetallic alloy Ga by low-temperature heat capacity and ultra-low-temperature thermal conductivity measurements. It\n",
          "Magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors lead to spin-polarized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) in-gap states. Chains of magnetic impurities offer one of the most viable routes for the realization of Majorana bound states, which hold promise for topological quantum computing. However, this ambitious goal looks distant, since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. To fill this gap, we propose an effective two-level system, YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impuritie\n",
          "In this paper, we numerically study the non-Abelian statistics of the zero-energy Majorana fermions at the end of Majorana chain and show its application to quantum computing by mapping it to spin model with special symmetry. In particular, by using transverse-field Ising model with Z2 symmetry, we verify the nontrivial non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions. Numerical evidence and comparison in both Majorana representation and spin representation are presented. The degenerate ground states of symm\n",
          "Oxygenation kinetics of YBa Cu 7-δ superconductor with silver (0%, 10% and 30% Ag by weight) have been studied by using thermogravimetric analysis at annealing temperatures ranging from to in air. The results show that both the silver addition and annealing temperature greatly influence the oxygenation processes of the YBa Cu 7-δ superconductor. The amounts of the oxygen loaded into Y123-Ag compounds increase with decreasing temperature. The silver additions also increase the sat\n",
          "Surface superconductivity has recently been observed on the (001) surface of the topological crystalline insulator Pb 1-x Sn Te using point-contact spectroscopy and theoretically proposed to be of the chiral p-wave type. In this paper, we closely examine the conditions for realizing robust chiral p-wave order in this system rather than conventional s-wave superconductivity. Further, within the p-wave superconducting phase, we identify parameter regimes where impurity bound (Shiba) states depend cruciall\n",
          "We consider one-dimensional superconducting wire where the total number of electrons can be controlled in the Coulomb blockade regime. We predict that soliton (kink) will spontaneously form in the system when the number of electrons is odd, because this configuration has lower energy. If the wire with an odd number of electrons is closed in ring, the phase difference on the two sides of the soliton will generate supercurrent detectable by SQUID. The two degenerate states with the current flowi\n",
          "The study of Majorana fermions is of great importance for the implementation of quantum computer. These modes are topologically protected and very stable. It is now well known that p-wave superconducting wire can sustain, in its topological non-trivial phase, Majorana quasiparticles at its ends. Since this type of superconductor is not found in nature, many methods have been devised to implement it. Most of them rely on the spin-orbit interaction. In this paper we study the superconducting properties of\n",

While energetic particle intensities at V1 change gradually over yr in the heliosheath, those at V2 vary by factor ∼10 in yr. Energetic partic\n",

          "By placing an atom into cavity, the electromagnetic mode structure of the cavity is modified. In cavity QED, one manifestation of this phenomenon is the appearance of gauge-dependent diamagnetic term, known as the contribution. Although in atomic cavity QED, the resulting modification in the eigenmodes is negligible, in recent superconducting circuit realizations, such corrections can be observable and may have qualitative implications. We revisit the canonical quantization procedure of circuit-QE\n",

We concentrate our attention on universal two-qutrit gate, which corresponds to controlled-NOT gate between qutrits. Using this gate and general gate of an individual qutrit, any gate can be decomposed into sequence of these gates. In particular, we show how this works for performing the quantum Fourier transform for qutrits.\n",

Observed effects include long tail in the CPMG echo train for short delays between pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the echo amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern\n",

We show that these observations are consistent with theory that incorporates decoherence arising from charge noise that gives rise to detuning fluctuations of the double dot. Because effects from charge noise are largest near the singlet-triplet avoided level crossing, the visibility of the oscillations is\n",
          "As high-resistivity normal-metal barrier for superconducting Josephson junctions, metal-silicon alloys appear to be good replacement for noble metals and have been applied to the development of quantum voltage standard circuits. We observed that the electrical properties of Nb-based junctions made with amorphous Nb Si 1-x barriers were slowly evolving over time when stored at room temperature. After systematically investigating both junctions and thin films, we have concluded that the changes in junct\n",
          "We calculate the tunneling current through long-line junctions of quantum Hall liquid and ͑i͒ another liquid, ͑ii͒ an integer quantum Hall liquid, and ͑iii͒ quantum wire. Momentum-resolved tunneling provides information about the number, propagation directions, and other features of the edge modes and thus helps distinguish several competing models of the 5/2 state. We investigate transport properties of two proposed Abelian states: and state, and four possible non-Abelian states:\n",
          "Single rare-earth ions in solids show great potential for quantum applications, including single-photon emission, quantum computing, and high-precision sensing. However, the linewidths of single rare-earth ions are often broadened due to perturbations associated with the detection methods. Identifying the dominant broadening sources is key to reduce the linewidths for practical applications. We report spectral broadening study on single Er 3+ ion in Si nanotransistor. The single ion spectra display\n",
          "Nano-structures with giant magnetic anisotropy energies (MAE) are desired in designing miniaturized magnetic storage and quantum computing devices. Previous works focused mainly on materials or elements with electrons. Here, by taking Bi-X(X=In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb) adsorbed on nitrogenized divacancy of graphene and Bi atom adsorbed on MgO(100) as examples, through ab initio and model calculations, we propose that special p-element dimers and single-adatoms on symmetry-matched substrates possess giant atomic\n",

The result contains universal boundary law violating term simply related to the more familiar entanglement entropy. We also obtain universal crossover function that smoothly interpolates between the zero-temperature result and the ordinary thermal Rényi entropy of Fermi liquid.

          "It is known that the n-qubit system has no unextendible product bases (UPBs) of cardinality -1, -2 and -3. On the other hand, the n-qubit UPBs of cardinality -4 exist for all 3. We prove that they do not exist for cardinality -5.\n",
          "We propose systematic procedure to construct all the possible bases with definite factorization structure (eigenstates of commuting monomials constructed as products of Pauli operators) for an n-qubit system, as well as the possibility of collecting them into mutually unbiased sets. We also discuss an algorithm for the determination of basis separability and propose criteria for complementarity between such bases. The results are applied to generate non-isomorphic complete sets of mutually unbiased\n",
          "We investigate the geometric characterization of pure state bipartite entanglement of ͑2 D͒-and ͑3 D͒-dimensional composite quantum systems. To this aim, we analyze the relationship between states and their images under the action of particular classes of local unitary operations. We find that invariance of states under the action of single-qubit and single-qutrit transformations is necessary and sufficient condition for separability. We demonstrate that in the ͑2 D͒-dimensional case the von Neumann\n",
          "We give practical, necessary and sufficient condition for two pure n-qubit states to be stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) equivalent. We also construct the SLOCC polynomial invariants of degree for even n-qubit (n 4) states. The polynomials are in the explicit form of determinants whose entries are polynomials of degree in the coefficients of the states. Further, the polynomials satisfy an SLOCC equation and therefore are invariant under SLOCC. The SLOCC equations\n",
          "We investigate cluster states of qubits with respect to their nonlocal properties. We demonstrate that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ͑GHZ͒ argument holds for any cluster state: more precisely, it holds for any partial, thence mixed, state of small number of connected qubits ͑five, in the case of one-dimensional lattices͒. In addition, we derive Bell inequality that is maximally violated by the four-qubit cluster state and is not violated by the four-qubit GHZ state.\n",
          "We classify, up to local unitary equivalence, local unitary stabilizer Lie algebras for symmetric mixed states of qubits into six classes. These include the stabilizer types of the Werner states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and its generalizations, and Dicke states. For all but the zero algebra, we classify entanglement types (local unitary equivalence classes) of symmetric mixed states that have those stabilizers. We make use of the identification of symmetric density matrices with polynomials\n",
          "We employ conditional Tsallis entropies to study the separability of symmetric one parameter and GHZ multiqubit mixed states. The strongest limitation on separability is realized in the limit ϱ, and is found to be much superior to the condition obtained using the von Neumann conditional entropy ͑q case͒. Except for the example of two qubit and three qubit symmetric states of GHZ family, the q-conditional entropy method leads to sufficient-but not necessary-conditions on separability.\n",
          "We introduce an operational entanglement classification of symmetric mixed states for an arbitrary number of qubits based on stochastic local operations assisted with classical communication (SLOCC operations). We define families of SLOCC entanglement classes successively embedded into each other, we prove that they are of nonzero measure, and we construct witness operators to distinguish them. Moreover, we discuss how arbitrary symmetric mixed states can be realized in the laboratory one-to-one corre\n",
          "Modern quantum technologies in the fields of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology require the creation and control of large ensembles of entangled particles. In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of particles. The entanglement generation relies on the fundamental particle-exchange symmetry in ensembles of identical particles, which lacks the standard notion of entanglement between clearly definable su\n",
