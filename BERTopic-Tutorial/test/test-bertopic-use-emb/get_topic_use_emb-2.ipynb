The objective is not only to recover the experimental value of the ground state mean energy of the atom, but rather to better approximate the unknown parameters of these trial\n",

To implement the scheme, physical qubits represented by the polarization states of single photons are probabilistically encoded into the two-photon states. Based on such encoding operation, nondestructive\n",

          "We propose scheme to generate quantum phase gate an unconventional geometric phase shift in an ion-trap system. Since the gate time is only related to the frequency of the vibrational mode, the present scheme, based on the resonant interaction of the trapped ions with standing-wave laser beam, requires much shorter gate time than the scheme based on the resonant interaction of the atoms and the cavity. Also the heating effect of the vibrational mode is negligible under certain conditions.\n",

However, high-finesse dielectric cavity mirrors can degrade in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), increasing the challenges of upgrading to cavity-coupled quantum systems. We observe the optical degradation of high-finesse dielectric optical cavity mirrors after high-temperature UHV bake in the form of substantial increase\n",

          "We introduce quantum control technique using polychromatic pulse trains, consisting of pulses with different carrier frequencies, i.e., different detunings with respect to the qubit transition frequency. We derive numerous polychromatic pulse trains, which generate broadband, narrowband, and passband excitation profiles for different target transition probabilities. This makes it possible to create high-fidelity excitation profiles which are either (i) robust to deviations in the experimental parameters,\n",
          "We propose and study model of dephasing due to an environment of bistable fluctuators. We apply our analysis to the decoherence of Josephson qubits, induced by background charges present in the substrate, which are also responsible for the 1͞f noise. The discrete nature of the environment leads to number of new features which are mostly pronounced for slowly moving charges. Far away from the degeneracy this model for the dephasing is solved exactly.\n",
          "Dynamical decoupling has been actively investigated since Viola first suggested using pulse sequence to protect qubit from decoherence. Since then, many schemes of dynamical decoupling have been proposed to achieve high-order suppression, both analytically and numerically. However, hitherto, there has not been systematic framework to understand all existing uniform -pulse dynamical decoupling schemes. In this report, we use the projection pulse sequences as basic building blocks and concatenation as\n",

In order to increase the robustness of the two coupled neural networks, the key idea is that sliding-mode-type controller is employed. Moreover, without the estimate values of the network unknown parameters taken as an updating object, new updating object is introduced in the constructing of controller.
